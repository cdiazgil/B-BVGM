It can be used with ‚Äúsize‚Äù referring to otolith size or fish length. Using a Bayesian hierarchical fitting strategy (Lunn et al. 2000) allows to use some a priori information for the estimates of the parameters. The model is implemented and run using the R2jags library of the R package (http://www.r-project.org/), which opens JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler, http://mathstat.helsinki.fi/openbugs/). Three Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) are run and semi-informative priors are considered. Specifically, prior distributions are based on the reasoning that all individuals come hierarchically from the same population with common normal distribution (mean = 0 and tolerance (1/square root of s.d.) equal to a value sampled from a gamma distribution with parameters with shape and scale = 0.001). Uniform distributions were considered for the VBGM parameters: t0 from -2 to 2 years, Linf range from 0 to 300 size units (to include the otolith measurements) and k range from 0 to 1 years-1. These values were based on the previous literature reported for small bodied coastal species at population levels (Gordoa and Mol√≠ 1997; Pajuelo and Lorenzo 2001; Al√≥s et al. 2010) and in all cases, the posterior distributions were much narrower than a the priors distributions. The first 100,000 iterations for all of the parameters were discarded (burned) and a thinning strategy adopted to ensure the temporal independence of successive values within the chain (only one out of every 10 consecutive values was kept). The convergence of the MCMC chains of all parameters was assessed by visual inspection of the plots of the iterations and tested using the Gelman-Rubin Statistic (Plummer et al. 2006), with values < 1.1 indicating convergence (Gelman et al. 2014). In all cases convergence was obtained after various iterations depending on the simulation (between 3,000 and 9,000 valid iterations) after applying a burning and thinning of the posterior distribution as described above. Among-population differences in the VBGM can be visualized using the Bayesian Credibility Intervals (2.5%-97.5%) of the posterior distribution of each parameter, and the Bayesian means can be used for testing the relationship among the VBGM parameters and any variable of interest."),
